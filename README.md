# A Panoply of Robots

This is a crowd-sourced tale of robot foibles.

For now, your mission to *plan* two robots and *implement* (write code for) one robot.

Please plan one "round-ish" robot (fits within, or does not extend past, the boundary of a circle).

Please plan one "rectangular-ish" robot (fits within the boundaries of a four-sided polygon with four right-angles).

For each robot:

* Make a clear plan (identify input, process, and output).  This can take the form of a sketch on a co-ordinate system, or, a series of rough storyboards. **Post your plans to Sesame.**
* It is important that your robot be anchored to the origin – the top left corner, or (0, 0).
* Fork and clone this repository (see instructions in your composition book).
* Implement your plan by writing well-organized, human readable code.
* Be sure to commit your code to the fork of your repository.

For inspiration – [you may wish to view this example](http://russellgordon.ca/rsgc/ics/2o/2016/spring/robots.png) – it's the same robot, in a few different configurations (it's head can extend upwards).  Your robot only needs to have one configuration (for now, although you may wish to think ahead about how your robot might look if it had more capabilities).
